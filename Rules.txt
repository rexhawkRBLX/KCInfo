**In-Game Rules**

To make the game enjoyable for all members, you are asked to follow the following rules:

**• New Life Rule (NLR):** When a subject dies in a pursuit, shout-out, etc... they are to be recognized as a new person with no prior history except listed on the database, all old charges are to be dropped. Warrants are still enforced.

**• Random Killing/Random Death Match/Revenge Killing:** You are asked not to shoot up a random scene, shoot a random person for no reason, or revenge kill. This is bannable.

**• Respect to all members:** We ask you to give respect to all members, and you will get respect on return. This keeps the game environment enjoyable. 

**• Roleplay Realistically:** Keep the Roleplay realistic. This means, do not do something you would not or could not do in real life. (i.e: Cuff Clip: Cuff someone from a far distance)

Report any rules broken to a member of the Administration Team.
